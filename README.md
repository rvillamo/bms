# Building Management System (BMS)

The goal of this project is to create the hardware and software aspects of a building management system (BMS), which has control and oversight over a buildingâ€™s mechanical and electrical systems. The implementation of the BMS should display statuses on an LCD screen, control lights, detect motion/human presence, control room temperature (HVAC), generate an energy bill, and enable a security system.

Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi
- LEDs
- LCD screen
- Push buttons
- PIR sensor
- DHT-11 (temperature and humidity sensor)
